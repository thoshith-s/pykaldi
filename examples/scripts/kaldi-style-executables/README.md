Kaldi style executables implemented using PyKaldi
-------------------------------------------------

Each subfolder contains an example Python script. These scripts take the same
inputs and produce the same outputs as their Kaldi counterparts. You can use
the `compare.sh` scripts to compare the outputs produced by PyKaldi with the
outputs produced by Kaldi.

Note that we implemented these executable scripts only for demonstration. We
have no plans of reimplementing existing Kaldi executables using PyKaldi.
