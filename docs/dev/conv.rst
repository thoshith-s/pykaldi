Coding Conventions
==================

While developing PyKaldi, we try our best to adhere to the following coding
conventions:

CLIF
----
Since CLIF C++ API descriptions for Python extensions look very much like Python
code with type hints, we try to follow to the Python style guide to the degree
it makes sense.


Python
------
PyKaldi Python source code largely adheres to `Google Python Style Guide
<http://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html>`_.


Documentation
-------------
Most of PyKaldi documentation is automatically generated with Sphinx autodoc
and napoleon extensions by pulling in docstrings from the Python modules.
The docstrings in PyKaldi source code mostly follow the `Google style
<http://sphinxcontrib-napoleon.readthedocs.io/en/latest/example_google.html>`_.

Since a large part of PyKaldi package consists of raw CLIF wrappers, we extended
CLIF C++ API description language to support optional docstrings. This allows
us to document PyKaldi modules without wrapping them further in Python. CLIF
docstrings are multiline strings enclosed by """triple double quotes""". They
largely follow the usual Python docstring conventions (PEP 257). If a docstring
is provided, then it overrides the surrogate docstring generated by CLIF.
